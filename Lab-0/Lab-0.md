## Questions
1) Plot the following function using appropriate increments for x (try minimum 2 different increments): U(x - 2), x in [-10,10], where U is the unit step function

2) Write a function that takes a 3 dimensional matrix (MxNxP), separates into M 2D matrices of size (NxP) and averages out the matrices and return the average matrix. Solve this without any loops and experiment with atleast two combinations of (M,N,P).
